# Phaser.js study

For my kid.
This is very easy game engine to play with.

### Documents:

Phaser 3 Main github documents are here(https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/index.html).
These are mainly for API.  We can search individual class and namespaces from search box at the top.

Tutorial is in Main Phaser website, here(https://phaser.io/learn).

Example repo is pretty big, but for preview resources, clone locally.
